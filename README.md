# Eyes

The Eyes exercise helped to practice using everything we have learned so far in CSS, HTML and Javascript to create shapes, color and movement.

To see the Demo:

1) Click on "Fork" to fork the repo to your own github repo 
2) From your github repo, choose the green "Code" button and from the pull-down menu choose to "Clone" using your SSH key and copy the URL
3) Go to your local Git (I use Gitbash from Windows Terminal) and type "git clone " and then paste the URL
4) Go to your IDE (I use Visual Studio) and open the folder where you saved the repo
5) Open a blank tab on your Internet browser and drag the Eyes.html file to it
6) You can then move your cursor around your screen and the eyes will follow in the same direction


# Road Map of Future Improvements
I would like to improve this demo by adding a timer, such that after one minute only one eye follows, then after another minute only the other eye follows, and finally after another minute both eyes follow again.
