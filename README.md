# Eyes

The Eyes exercise helped to practice using everything we have learned so far in CSS, HTML and Javascript to create shapes, color and movement.

To see the Demo:

1) Click on "Fork" to fork the repo to your own github repo 
2) From your github repo, choose the green "Code" button and from the pull-down menu choose to "Clone" using your SSH key and copy the URL
3) Go to your local Git (I use Gitbash from Windows Terminal) and type "git clone " and then paste the URL
4) Go to your IDE (I use Visual Studio) and open the folder where you saved the repo
5) Open a blank tab on your Internet browser and drag the Eyes.html file to it
